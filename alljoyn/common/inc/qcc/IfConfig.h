/**
 * @brief Get information regarding the network interfaces on the
 * host.
 *
 * In the mobile device environment, it is often the case that network
 * interfaces will come up and go down unpredictably as the underlying Wi-Fi is
 * associated with or disassociated from access points as the device physically
 * moves.
 *
 * Different operating systems return different tidbits of information regarding
 * their network interfaces using sometimes wildly differing mechanisms, and
 * reporting what is conceptually the same information in sometimes wildly
 * differing formats.
 *
 * It is often desired to get information about network interfaces irrespective
 * of whether or not IP addresses are assigned or whether IPv4 or IPv6 addresses
 * may be present.
 *
 * This function provides an OS-indepenent way of reporting network interface
 * information in a relatively abstract way, providing as much or as little
 * information as may be available at any time.
 *
 * @param entries A vector of IfConfigEntry that will be filled out
 *     with information on the found network interfaces.
 *
 * @return Status of the operation.  Returns ER_OK on success.
 *
 * @see IfConfigEntry
